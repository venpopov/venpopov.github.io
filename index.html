        <h3>Research interests</h3>
		<p>My research deals with a variety of topics, but there is a string running through them all and that is memory. Our memories are what define us as individuals, and memory is the faculty which provides the information necessary for other cognitive functions. My desire is to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms of memory formation, consolidation and retrieval, the executive processes that direct them, the way semantic knowledge is abstracted from episodes, and the way it is represented in the brain. In my view, this is crucial for understanding and unifying all other aspects of cognition.</p>
		
		<p>Specifically, I am interested in how the medial temporal lobe (MTL) encodes the spatio-temporal context necessary to bind events and objects into a coherent story, and how the prefrontal cortex (PFC) integrates task demands and contextual cues supplied from the MTL to selectively retrieve information from neocortical areas. </p>
		
		<p>Further, I want to understand the mechanisms through which the temporary activation of cortical representations lead to long lasting structural changes in the networks that support those representations. How are those networks organized, and how do their components interact to support not only the learning of individual episodes, but the generalization of information into context-independent semantic knowledge?</p>
		
		<p>How do people, who are constantly bombarded with episodic information, manage to remember much of it without conscious effort, while they forget semantic details they explicitly wanted to remember? How are automatic and control processes differentially engaged in memory encoding, and what determines their success in subsequent retrieval? There is evidence that the VLPFC is more strongly engaged when we retrieve weakly associated items, but how precisely does their retrieval become less dependent on the VLPFC as they grow more strongly associated in time?</p>
		
		<p>Finally, what fascinates me is not so much the ability to use memories to inform us of our past, but that we are able to recombine them to anticipate and plan for alternative future events. This ability to mentally simulate the future bestows upon us the unique advantage to prepare in advance for events that might occur, and further, it allows us to build, sustain and pursue long-term goals. </p>
		
		<p> We know that episodic future simulations are accompanied by hippocampal and default network activity, but what are the precise neural mechanisms through which retrieved memory elements are recombined into novel scenarios? Moreover, the fact that both real memories and simulations depend on hippocampal activity raises another important question – how are memories of simulations encoded, so that we are able to subsequently differentiate them from actually occurred events?</p>
		
		<h4>Relational reasoning</h4>
		<p>Another major motivation behind my research has always been to understand how we acquire and use conceptual knowledge. Life constantly faces us with novel situations, people, objects or problems, which we must comprehend and deal with. Such comprehension is necessarily based on previously stored knowledge, and one way to cope with that novelty is to use analogies – to identify situations in memory that share consistent relational similarities with the situation at hand, and to make inferences based on those shared similarities. </p>

		<p>Through my research I came to believe that the ability to reason about relations is fundamental for who we are as a species, and is arguably what differentiates us from other animals. This fueled my desire to understand the basic psychological and neural mechanisms of analogical reasoning.</p>
		
		<p>For me, one of the most pressing questions in this field is how people abstract relational structure from non-relational sensory input. For analogy to occur, one must be able to infer relations from the objects that instantiate them, and to retrieve memory structures that are relationally similar to the entertained target. Most computational models of analogy assume that relations are readily available, but they are usually implicit and not directly visualized in the environment; rather they must be elicited out of the continuous multimodal informational stream.</p>
		
		<p>Relational recognition is further complicated by the fact that numerous potential relations hold between every two objects. Then, how do people retrieve appropriate analogues from memory, when many relational matches can be established?</p>
