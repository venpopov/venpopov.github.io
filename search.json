    "text": "I try my best. I really do.\nI use renv for package management. My blog is built with Quarto. I use caching and freezing so posts don’t get recomputed every time. I hadn’t touched the blog in a few months. Today, I just wanted to fix a couple of typos on my publications page. Two minutes of work. Run quarto render. Done.\nExcept, of course, not done.\nI open the project and renv tells me the project is out of sync. Cannot render because package Rmarkdown is missing. Fine. I run renv::restore(), whose entire purpose is to restore the package environment to its previous state.\nIt immediately fails while trying to install Matrix from source.\nI’ve never had that problem before. A bit of googling reveals that installing Matrix requires a Fortran compiler (???). The official instructions are here: https://mac.r-project.org/tools/. I do not remember ever needing this in the past. I try to force renv to use binaries instead of building from source. That also fails.\nAlright. Fine. I install a Fortran compiler. Matrix installs successfully.\nOne minute later, renv::restore() fails again—this time because it can’t install stringi. The error message is completely opaque. I paste it into an AI, which helpfully explains:\n\n“This error occurs because of a conflict between the modern [[noreturn]] attribute in R 4.5 and an older NORET declaration within the stringi package, specifically on ARM64 macOS.”\n\nJesus fucking christ.\nYes, I updated R last month from 4.4.2 to 4.5. And now one of the most fundamental string manipulation packages in the entire R ecosystem—on which half the world depends—can’t be installed?\nOkay. Fine. Surely I can just install a newer version of stringi. I stop the restore process and run:\nrenv::install(\"stringi\")\nThat works.\nBut now I have a problem: if I run renv::restore() again, it will just try to install the older version and fail all over again. So I need to snapshot the current state.\nI run renv::snapshot(), and it tells me:\nThe following required packages are not installed:\n- ambient\n- bmm\n- fields\n- ggdark\n- ggplot2\n- here\n- httpgd\n- kableExtra\n- patchwork\n- rmarkdown\n- tidyr\n- viridis\n- wesanderson\nPackages must first be installed before renv can snapshot them.\nWhy are they not installed? I’m on the same machine. Same project. I haven’t changed anything.\nOh. Right. I updated R. Since R is a global installation, renv considers this a fresh library and wants everything reinstalled.\nFine. I choose option 2: install the packages, then snapshot.\nEverything installs—except ggdark.\nError: package 'ggdark' is not available\nWhat.\nA quick google search leads me to CRAN, which cheerfully explains:\nPackage ‘ggdark’ was removed from the CRAN repository.\nFormerly available versions can be obtained from the archive.\nArchived on 2025-11-07 as issues were not corrected despite reminders.\nOh for fuck’s sake.\nI recognize this exact message. It recently bit me with another ggplot utility package, gghalves. ggplot just went through a major version bump to v4, and it broke a bunch of extension packages. If the maintainer doesn’t fix things quickly enough, CRAN just removes the package.\nUnfortunately, R’s entire package ecosystem is built on the assumption that every package should work with the latest version of every other package. That assumption collapses completely the moment you care about reproducibility.\nThe whole point of renv is that I’ve already specified which versions of ggplot2 and ggdark this project used. When I chose “install the packages” during snapshotting, I assumed renv would install the versions recorded in the lockfile.\nBut something clearly didn’t work.\nWhat exactly failed?\n\nDid renv try to download the correct version of ggdark, but CRAN refused because it’s archived?\nOr did renv ignore the lockfile at that point and try to install the latest version instead?\n\nCRAN does link to the archived sources, so in principle the old version exists. But apparently not in a way that renv can use automatically.\nI snapshot without installing the missing packages. That technically works, but I’m stuck with an inconsistent environment.\nI’m not even using ggplot v4. This isn’t a usage problem. It’s an infrastructure problem: R’s dependency system forces compatibility with the present, and fights you when you try to live in the past.\nFine. I try installing from the archive manually:\nrenv::install(\"ggdark@0.2.1\")\nThat works.\nI try renv::snapshot() again.\nNow it fails on httpgd.\nSame story. Package removed from CRAN. Archived. The version in my lockfile is httpgd@2.0.2.\nrenv::install(\"httpgd@2.0.2\")\nWorks.\nWhy am I doing this manually? Isn’t this exactly what renv is supposed to manage for me?\nAt this point I start wondering whether this has something to do with Quarto. Some posts use post-specific packages declared via renv::use(\"packagename@version\"), as recommended in the documentation. Maybe those dependencies don’t fully participate in the main restore/snapshot logic? Maybe I’ve built myself a beautiful little Rube Goldberg machine of reproducibility.\nOne last attempt:\nrenv::snapshot()\nFinally:\nrenv::status()\nNo issues found -- the project is in a consistent state.\nWhat time is it?\nTwo hours have passed. I wanted to fix two typos.\nI run quarto render.\nHallelujah—it works.\nI need a drink.\nNever mind. I forgot I don’t drink.\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{popov2026,\n  author = {Popov, Vencislav},\n  title = {Package Management and Reproducibility Are a Nightmare},\n  date = {2026-02-03},\n  url = {https://venpopov.com/posts/2026/package-management-and-reproducibility-are-a-nightmare/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPopov, Vencislav. 2026. “Package Management and Reproducibility\nAre a Nightmare.” February 3, 2026. https://venpopov.com/posts/2026/package-management-and-reproducibility-are-a-nightmare/."

    "text": "Widespread glitches\nOn October 11th, 2025, the Center for Open Science (COS) announced that the Open Science Framework — its flagship platform for preprints, data, and code — had received a major redesign. The update promised “to make managing research projects easier, faster, and more intuitive.”\nWithin days, many discovered that the new redesign ironically came with slower loading times, but more troubling, with a host of bugs and glitches:\n\n\nPSA: seems like the update broke the ability to directly download files with a link, like osf.io/XXXX/download this lead to an error in one of my R package vignettes, and presumably will break lots of code.[image or embed]\n\n— Ruben C. Arslan (@ruben.the100.ci) October 12, 2025 at 10:34 AM\n\n\n\nThanks. I think this is urgent. I suspect it also broke Google Scholar listing PDFs from OSF, at least I get broken links for some, no links for others and generally OSF seems to be massively downranked in the list of sources. Started getting email requests for PDFs again.\n\n— Ruben C. Arslan (@ruben.the100.ci) October 16, 2025 at 11:43 AM\n\n\n\n@cos.io Why cant I read in rds files from my repo? I was trying to reproduce my manuscript and now I cant read in rds files from the site. I am going to assume it has to do with the new UI?\n\n— jgeller1phd.bsky.social (@jgeller1phd.bsky.social) October 11, 2025 at 5:57 PM\n\n\n\nIs anyone else experiencing significant issues (lags, not loading) with OSF (@cos.io) since the interface update?\n\n— Charlotte Pennington 🌻 (@drcpennington.bsky.social) October 22, 2025 at 7:51 PM\n\n\n\n🪲 OSF Update: Ongoing Fixes Following the OSF redesign, some issues have been identified:\n\nSome custom registry templates may not showall fields\nOSF shows a max. of 10 contributors\nSome pages load slowly or seem unresponsive\n\nThese are on our critical fix list & should be resolved soon. (1/2)\n\n— Center for Open Science (@cos.io) October 17, 2025 at 7:46 PM\n\n\n\nAlso, - Login screen doesn’t work on Safari - Preregistrations impossible (got many error messages & after I was finally able to submit got an email saying trouble archiving my preregistration so it wasn’t completed)… this means I can’t actually run my study :( - Symbols not rendering (e.g., &, &lt;)\n\n— Cassandra Chapman (@cassandrachapman.bsky.social) October 22, 2025 at 11:38 PM\n\n\nI do not mention complaints about design, as those are subjective. But it was worrisome that a redesign would break existing download link patterns without a redirect - this should not happen to an archival service. To their credit, COS fixed that particular problem quickly, though it should never needed fixing in the first place. The performance issues remain, and the irony that this performance update made performance worse is not lost to anyone. What seemed like transitional friction soon turned into something stranger."

It was not one “preprint flagged as spam.” Anything I — or anyone associated with me — had uploaded since 2017 was completely inaccessible, and OSF was effectively communicating to the world that this work no longer existed.\n\n&lt;On Nov 3, 2025 at 16:45 +0100, Ven Popov, wrote:&gt;\nAs I replied in my previous email, I already filled out the form.\nFurthermore, it is not one preprint that is inaccessible. All of the 20+ preprints that I have published on OSF since 2017 are unavailable. Neither the OSF links from my profile, nor the Google Scholar links that have worked for years can be opened.\nPlease escalate this issue. This is a serious misstep on OSF’s part. I have had an account with OSF for 8 years, I have published about 20 preprints during this time, and none of them are available. For some of them, the OSF links might be the only record online of these published works, and it is a serious issue concerning the longevity of scholarship that an archival platform like OSF cannot allow to happen.\n@Brian, can you please get your support team to take this seriously? I’m getting repeated emails asking me to do something I already did and overlooking the extent of the problem. Please see the message history for the detailed report and links to my profile, a subset of broken preprint links, and an API error from Google Scholar links.\n\nWithin hours, OSF staff identified the cause: my account had been automatically flagged as spam by their filters. Once the flag was removed, everything reappeared."

You are correct it looks like your project was caught in our spam filter. As a free open access platform we are frequently the target of spammers, and therefore we must use multiple different spam filters that take a plethora of different factors into account when flagging spam, everything from odd titles to suspicious activity from a nearby IP address could get flagged. Truthfully it’s hard to tell why your content got its attention. I’m sorry for the inconvenience. I’ve removed the flag from material and your content should be active again!\n\nIt was an honest reply — but also a disturbing one.\nOSF’s filters had quarantined everything I or any of my colleagues had ever uploaded, without warning, without a visible flag on my dashboard, and without preserving any metadata or landing pages. Public DOIs and Google Scholar entries now pointed to HTTP 410 “Resource deleted” responses — a code that explicitly signals permanent removal to search engines.\nIn other words, for several days, OSF’s infrastructure told the world that our work no longer existed."

    "text": "The Deeper Problem\nThis incident isn’t about data loss — most of my materials were mirrored elsewhere. The issue is trust.\nResearchers use OSF because it promises persistence. It issues DOIs, integrates with journals, and serves as part of the scholarly record. That promise was violated — not through malice, but through a structural design choice: an automated filter was allowed to silently deindex archival content.\nSpam detection is necessary. But a true archive must never delete first and explain later. An archive is defined by its immutability and accountability.\nThe design flaw wasn’t that a spam flag existed — it’s that its activation could unpublish a decade’s worth of DOI-assigned material without human review, notification, or even the retention of metadata.\nThis episode highlights a broader fragility in the open science ecosystem. The infrastructure of modern scholarship — repositories, indexing services, DOI registries — runs on trust. When that infrastructure silently fails, the damage is epistemic: we lose not just access to data, but confidence in the permanence of the scientific record.\nAn archival platform must therefore:\n\nRetain metadata and landing pages even when content is quarantined.\nNotify users when materials are flagged or hidden\nRequire human verification before suppressing DOI-linked material.\nUse non-destructive HTTP codes for temporary removals.\n\nThese are not minor UX fixes — they are the foundations of reliability in digital scholarship. I made this much clear in an email reply:\n\n&lt;On Mon, Nov 3, 2025 at 2:26 PM Ven Popov wrote:&gt;\nThank you for resolving the issue and restoring access to my materials. I understand that OSF, as a free and open platform, must protect itself against spam.\nHowever, the way your spam-filtering system currently operates is unacceptable and incompatible with OSF’s stated mission as an archival repository. Automatically blocking access to more than twenty DOI-registered preprints, datasets, and supplementary materials spanning nearly a decade — including work co-authored by dozens of researchers and cited in published papers — is not a minor glitch. It constitutes a violation of the very FAIR principles OSF promotes and undermines trust in your platform as part of the scholarly record.\nWorse, the system suppressed all metadata and landing pages, returning an HTTP 410 “Resource deleted” response. That code explicitly signals to search engines that a resource has been permanently removed and should be de-indexed. This means the issue not only disrupted access but actively damaged the discoverability and citation continuity of legitimate research outputs.\nI fully support the need for robust spam protection. But the current implementation — silent removal of legitimate archival content, without notice or human verification, and with a response that signals permanent deletion — is deeply inconsistent with COS’s commitments to openness, transparency, and persistence.\nI urge COS to review this policy and implement safeguards such as:\n\nHuman review before suppressing any DOI-assigned or public scholarly record.\nRetention of metadata and landing pages for any quarantined content.\nClear notifications to affected users.\nUse of non-destructive HTTP status codes (e.g., 451 or 503) for temporary suppression.\n\nThese are not just usability issues; they concern the credibility of OSF as a reliable component of the scientific infrastructure.\nI am deeply troubled by this incident, and I do not say this lightly. I have been a staunch supporter of COS and its mission for years. But this event exposes an infrastructural weakness that seriously undermines trust in the OSF platform.\nI would appreciate a response from COS leadership that demonstrates an understanding of the gravity of this failure and provides a clear plan to prevent similar occurrences in the future.\nI intend to publish this correspondence publicly, and I hope that I can do so alongside a response that acknowledges these concerns and reaffirms COS’s commitment to openness, transparency, and durability in scientific communication."

I have not heard of a case like this, so while it was a painful experience that you had to deal with, hopefully the exposure of the problem with your diligent reporting will help us to identify the extent to which it is occurring more widely and develop effective solutions.\nThanks again for giving us such useful reporting on your experience with this to help us continue to improve the service.\n\nDespite this response, I was still deeply troubled. I briefly considered whether I’m overreacting. After consulting several colleagues, they were unanimous: the severity is not that it happened to me, but that it could happen at all — silently and retroactively. As one colleague put it:\n\nI agree, I think the issue is more severe than it sounds like. The effect is crazy to me. Not only that they retrospectively delete the stuff but also how many people can be affected by it. It’s already severe in your case with a large network of collaborators. But imagine Klaus’s account gets flagged and he doesn’t realize it. This would probably take hundreds of preprints offline, which are primary the work of others [junior researchers]. It’s bad enough that they take the stuff down that you put on OSF but it also deletes the work where someone else just linked your name with? This also can’t be right…\n\nAfter some reflection, I followed up with Brian Nosek with a longer message explaining why the issue mattered so deeply: not because of personal inconvenience, but because silent retroactive suppression of long-standing records is incompatible with the role of an archive.\n\n&lt; On Nov 4, 2025 at 13:49 +0100, Ven Popov wrote:&gt;\nThank you for the thoughtful response. I appreciate that you will take this case seriously in developing future solutions.\nI just really want to stress why I am so concerned about this having happened. It’s not about my work and that it affected me personally, although that clearly made me more motivated to get to the bottom of it. My work is also backed up on other platforms, including ResearchGate, a University of Zurich repository and my personal website. The real problem is that something like this should not be possible to happen in the first place, let alone as the result of an automated filter.\nWhatever the reason my account was flagged, an automated filter should never have the authority to retroactively block access to the work of hundreds of researchers simply because I’m listed as a co-author. These were not new uploads but materials that had been part of the scholarly record for nearly a decade.\nI was lucky to notice the disappearance within days; others might not. Under different circumstances, months could have passed during which all these digital objects appeared effectively erased. The consequences for more prominent researchers with hundreds of linked projects - and for junior collaborators relying on those links - could be far more severe.\nYour own guidelines stress that even authors themselves cannot delete accepted preprints - that preprints can only be withdrawn, and that the associated metadata and reasons for withdrawn will always remain part of the record.\nI considered whether I might be overreacting, but after discussing the issue with several colleagues, everyone agrees that this is a critical infrastructure-level bug. This requires more than a patch for this particular case, but systems in place to ensure that nothing can in principle cause something like it to happen in the future.\nI am writing all this out in detail not to attack COS or its work on maintaining OSF. It’s exactly the opposite - I share all COS values and view it as a fundamentally important institution. The traditional academic publishing system is rotten to core, but in order for any reform to succeed long-term, people must trust the infrastructure and systems in place. I want to see COS and OSF continue to succeed and continue to play the vital role that it has attained. This is why I am being so adamant about this incident being taken so seriously.\n\nHis reply was thoughtful and for the moment I am satisfied that this incident will be taken seriously:\n\n&lt;On Nov 4, 2025 at 14:45 +0100, Brian Nosek, wrote:&gt;\nThanks for the follow-up. There is nothing inappropriate at all about your comments or approach. It is very clear that your comments are made in good faith to help us improve the services and meet the aspirations of reliable, persistent open scholarship.

Ideally, I’d still like an official statement from COS about what they plan to do to ensure that something like this doesn’t happen again."

In other words, I can finally afford to act on my principles (as absurd as that sounds).\nI am not yet ready to share the full extent of what this entails, and I plan a longer post about the future of academic publishing. But last week was the first time I took action consistent with these principles, specifically my belief that all peer review should be open, published alongside the work it reviews. I received a standard review request from a respected APA journal, and this was my response:\n\nDear XXX,\nThank you for inviting me to review this submission. I would be glad to review the manuscript if my review and the subsequent author responses are published alongside the paper, should it be accepted.\nI understand this is not the current practice at XXX, but I firmly believe that open review is the future of academic publishing. It is a responsibility we owe to the public that funds our research. This is not about receiving credit for my review work but about promoting transparency and accountability in the peer review process. Many modern publishing platforms already support this practice.\nI appreciate that finding reviewers is challenging and that this request might make your job as an editor more difficult.\nBest regards,\nVen\n\nWill this have any effect? I doubt it. The system is too rigid. I expect that the editor would ask me to reconsider, and move on to other reviewers. Which is unfortunate, because I really don’t want to add more burden to a difficult job. But change has to start from somewhere.\nUpdate: As I suspected, the Editor sent me a polite email saying that the journal currently does not allow this, but that they will keep reviewing their policies as practices in the field change.\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{popov2024,\n  author = {Popov, Vencislav},\n  title = {Taking a Stand on Open Peer Review},\n  date = {2024-08-04},\n  url = {https://venpopov.com/posts/2024/taking-a-stand-on-open-peer-review/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPopov, Vencislav. 2024. “Taking a Stand on Open Peer\nReview.” August 4, 2024. https://venpopov.com/posts/2024/taking-a-stand-on-open-peer-review/."

    "text": "My relationship with blogging is complicated. I made my first blog about 15 years ago, fresh out of high school. WordPress was the dominant platform at the time, and my blog wasn’t anything particularly interesting - I shared some vapid attempts at poetry and short story writing, some travel logs, and a mish-mash of other topics1.\nI have never liked WordPress, for mostly the same reasons that I don’t like most software - I found every action incredibly cumbersome. Shortly thereafter I joined Facebook and Twitter, two platforms I no longer use, and most of my writing took on the “micro-blogging” nature that social media lends itself to so easily. I’ve always suspected that one of the reasons social media blew up was that it made it so easy to write, share, and follow content. At some point during my PhD (circa 2017), I created another WordPress blog, out of a desire to write longer pieces on more technical topics. That blog was again short-lived and the reason was simple - I wanted to write about programming, data analysis, and R, to share computational insights, but WordPress was a poor medium for it. At the time I was just starting to get enamored with literate programming (Jupyter notebooks were hot off the press), and the ease with which I could create computational writing contrasted starkly with the difficulty of sharing such writing on the internet.\nLast year I discovered Quarto and I immediately became excited by the possibilities. I rebuilt my personal website with it and set up this blog to go with it. I expected to post a lot more often than I have done in reality. There are many reasons for this - from starting a new tenured position, to being a typical overworked, overextended, and overcommitted academic.\nWhile I can’t do anything about that, I realized that one mental barrier arose every time I considered making a new post. Despite how easy Quarto makes it to publish technical material, there are a number of steps, at least in the way I have currently set up my system, that are just busywork, which I have to do any time I want to create a new post:\nFor some reason, the first three steps, as small as they appear, were a mental barrier that stopped me from even beginning new posts. Ideally, I want this to be as simple as possible. So I decided to write a bash script that automates it."

I already had a markdown document that describes in plain language the steps I need to do when creating new blog posts2. So could the built-in Copilot in VSCode write me a bash script just by being told to implement the steps I’ve described in my little instruction manual?\nIt worked flawlessly, and this code was the result after a few iterations:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Prompt for post details\nread -p \"Enter post title: \" title\nread -p \"Enter post subtitle: \" subtitle\nread -p \"Enter post categories (comma-separated): \" categories\n\n# Convert title to a slug for the folder name\nslug=$(echo \"$title\" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cd '[:alnum:] ' | tr ' ' '-')\n\n# Create the new post directory\nyear=$(date +%Y)\npost_dir=\"$HOME/venpopov.com/posts/$year/$slug\"\n\n# Check if the directory already exists\nif [ -d \"$post_dir\" ]; then\n  echo \"Error: The directory $post_dir already exists.\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nmkdir -p \"$post_dir\"\n\n# Get today's date\ndate=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\n\n# Append the current year to the categories list\ncategories=\"$categories, $year\"\n\n# Create the .qmd file with the provided metadata\ncat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; \"$post_dir/index.qmd\"\n---\ntitle: \"$title\"\nsubtitle: \"$subtitle\"\ncategories: [$(echo \"$categories\" | sed 's/,/, /g')]\ndate: \"$date\"\n---\nEOF\n\necho \"New post created at $post_dir/index.qmd\"\n\n# Open the new post in the default editor\ncode \"$post_dir/index.qmd\"\nI saved this code in a file new_blog_post and Copilot instructed me that I can make it executable from the command line by first setting file permission via:\nchmod +x new_blog_post\nI saved this file in a directory on my path, so now when I want to create a new blog post, I simply open a terminal and type\nnew_blog_post\nThis prompts me to enter a title for the post, a subtitle and some tags, then creates all the necessary boilerplate and opens the file in VSCode for editing.

In any case, I have a tendency to fall into rabbit holes when learning new things, and this is the last thing I want to do right now while trying to optimize my workflow!

    "text": "What is bmm for?\nbmm provides a simple and intuitive interface for fitting measurement models in psychology using Bayesian methods. It is designed to be accessible to researchers with little to no experience with Bayesian statistics or cognitive modeling. If you know how to fit a mixed-effects regression model in R, you already know nearly everything you need to fit a measurement model with bmm.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut first things first: what are measurement models and why do we need them?\nIf you are a meteorologist, you can measure atmospheric temperature with a thermometer. And while thermometers are technically indirect measures, the relationship between the volume of a liquid and its temperature is so strong and so well understood that we take it for granted.\nIf you are a psychologist, things get a bit more complicated.\nBehavioral and psychological data are messy and only rough proxies for what they are supposed to measure. We rarely care about how much time it takes someone to press a button after a flashing light, how precisely they can remember a specific shade of blue, or how similar they judge two badly drawn alien animals to be. Such data are only interesting insofar as they tell us something about the underlying psychological processes that govern attention, perception, decision making, memory and categorization.\nTo make matters even more difficult, usually multiple distinct cognitive processes contribute to behavior. Combined, these issues often make it difficult to draw clear conclusions from behavioral data alone. Running t.tests on averaged raw behavioral data can only get you so far. Measurement models are an important tool to bridge the gap between latent psychological constructs and observable behavioral data.\nSuch measurement models are nowadays used in many different areas of psychology. Some of the more popular models include drift diffusion models in decision making, signal detection theory models in perception and memory, and mixture models in visual working memory. The basic idea uniting these approaches is that we can decompose one or more observed measures (e.g., reaction times, accuracy rates, angular deviation, confidence ratings) into distinct theoretically meaningful parameters that reflect latent psychological processes (e.g., decision thresholds, different memory strength signals, the quality or precision of representations). These derived parameters can then be used to test hypotheses about the underlying cognitive processes that govern behavior."

And even when researchers do use these models, many (*cough *) rely on ad-hoc custom implementations that are not well-documented, not well-tested, not well-understood, not easily portable to new experiments, and not using optimal inference methods. This is where bmm comes in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditionally, to fit a measurement model in psychology, you had to build it yourself. The simple reality is, however, that most researchers don’t have the time, resources, or expertise to build and fit these models from scratch. This is doubly true for Bayesian hierarchical implementations, which require a different set of tools and skills than traditional maximum likelihood estimation. And even for those who do have the skills, the process can be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is why we started working on the bmm package in the first place - we were tired of doing the same thing over and over again for every new project. What started as a personal project to make our own daily work easier has now turned into a fully-fledged R package. What we have built is a package that allows you to fit a wide range of measurement models with just a few lines of code.\nYou no longer need to:\n\ncopy-paste custom Jags or Stan code from one project to the next (or worse, try to decipher someone else’s code!) and painstakingly adjust it for your new experiment\nworry about whether you have correctly specified your priors or likelihoods\nworry about whether you have correctly implemented your model\nworry about how to adjust the script for your new experimental design and to spend hours debugging it\n\nThe bmm package takes care of all of that for you.\nWhile there exist tools for some measurement models, such as for drift diffusion models (via the wiener distribution in brms for R or via the HDDM package for Python), this is not the case for the vast majority of measurement models used in psychology. The bmm package aims to fill this gap by providing a general framework that can be extended and continuously improved by the community."

The IMM model attributes errors to different sources of activation in memory: target features, non-target features, the spacial distance between them, and random noise1.\nBefore we go into the different parts, here is the entire code that you would need to fit the IMM model to the data. Yes, it’s that simple:\nlibrary(bmm)\n\n# load the data\nmy_data &lt;- oberauer_lin_2017\n\n# inform the model about the data structure\nimm_model &lt;- imm(\n  resp_error = \"dev_rad\",\n  nt_features = \"col_nt\",\n  nt_distances = \"dist_nt\",\n  set_size = \"set_size\",\n  version = \"full\",\n  regex = TRUE\n)\n\n# specify the regression formula for the model parameters\nimm_formula &lt;- bmmformula(\n  c ~ 0 + set_size + (0 + set_size | ID),\n  a ~ 0 + set_size + (0 + set_size | ID),\n  s ~ 0 + set_size + (0 + set_size | ID),\n  kappa ~ 0 + set_size + (0 + set_size | ID)\n)\n\n# fit the model via `brms` and `Stan`\nimm_fit &lt;- bmm(\n  formula = imm_formula,\n  data = my_data,\n  model = imm_model,\n  cores = 4\n)\nLet’s take a brief look at the data we are working with. In this case, the dependent variable is dev_rad - the deviation of the response from the target color (in radians). col_nt1 to col_nt7are the colors of the non-target items which were studied but are not being tested (coded relative to the target). Finally, dist_nt1 to dist_nt7 are the spatial distances of the non-target items from the target item, and set_size is the number of items in the display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nsession\ntrial\nset_size\ndev_rad\ncol_nt1\ncol_nt2\ncol_nt3\ncol_nt4\ncol_nt5\ncol_nt6\ncol_nt7\ndist_nt1\ndist_nt2\ndist_nt3\ndist_nt4\ndist_nt5\ndist_nt6\ndist_nt7\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n7\n0.3839724\n0.8726646\n0.8552113\n2.7750735\n2.094395\n1.2566371\n0.0698132\nNA\n1.9332878\n2.416610\n1.9332878\n0.4833219\n0.9666439\n2.899932\nNA\n\n\n1\n1\n2\n3\n-0.4537856\n0.8552113\n1.9547688\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n1.9332878\n2.416610\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n5\n-0.0872665\n0.7155850\n-2.6179939\n-1.0297443\n1.378810\nNA\nNA\nNA\n0.9666439\n2.899932\n2.4166097\n1.9332878\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n1\n1\n4\n6\n0.3665191\n0.2617994\n2.0420352\n0.1047198\n1.099557\n-0.9250245\nNA\nNA\n0.4833219\n2.899932\n0.9666439\n0.9666439\n1.9332878\nNA\nNA\n\n\n1\n1\n5\n1\n-0.0349066\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n1\n1\n6\n1\n0.1396263\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo fit the IMM model to this data, we need to follow a few simple steps:\n\n1) Specify the model\nFirst, set up the bmmodel object to specify which variables in your data contain information about the identity of the target and non-target features, the distances between them, and the set size of the display. For the IMM model, this would look like this:\n\nimm_model &lt;- imm(\n  resp_error = \"dev_rad\",\n  nt_features = \"col_nt\",\n  nt_distances = \"dist_nt\",\n  set_size = \"set_size\",\n  version = \"full\",\n  regex = TRUE\n)\n\nHere we used the regex option to specify that columns which begin with col_nt and dist_nt should be treated as non-target features and distances, respectively. This is useful when you have multiple non-target features and distances in your data (instead of enumerating them all).\n\n\n2) Specify the regression formula for the model parameters\nSecond, specify how the parameters of the model should vary over different conditions. A list of all model parameters and their meaning is saved in the model object and can be accessed using the parameters element.\n\nimm_model$parameters\n#&gt; $mu1\n#&gt; Location parameter of the von Mises distribution for memory responses (in radians). Fixed internally to 0 by default.\n#&gt; \n#&gt; $kappa\n#&gt; [1] \"Concentration parameter of the von Mises distribution\"\n#&gt; \n#&gt; $a\n#&gt; [1] \"General activation of memory items\"\n#&gt; \n#&gt; $c\n#&gt; [1] \"Context activation\"\n#&gt; \n#&gt; $s\n#&gt; [1] \"Spatial similarity gradient\"\n\nUsing this information, we can set up the bmmformula for the different model parameters. Let’s say we want to first get an idea how all parameters vary across set_size:\n\nimm_formula &lt;- bmmformula(\n  c ~ 0 + set_size + (0 + set_size | ID),\n  a ~ 0 + set_size + (0 + set_size | ID),\n  s ~ 0 + set_size + (0 + set_size | ID),\n  kappa ~ 0 + set_size + (0 + set_size | ID)\n)\n\nThe bmmformula object is closely aligned with the brmsformula syntax and allows for an easy specification of grouped effects. In this case, we assume random effects for all parameters over the ID variable, thus implementing a hierarchical model estimating individual differences in all parameters across the different set sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTake a closer look at the formula object.\n\n\n\nThis is where the power and flexibility of this approach comes from. You can specify any combination of fixed and random effects for any parameter in the model. This allows you to test a wide range of hypotheses about how the parameters of the model vary across different experimental conditions. In essence, fitting a hierarchical measurement model is not much different from fitting a mixed-effects regression model. You can find a more comprehensive tutorial on the bmmformula syntax and features in the online vignette\n\n\n\n\n3) Fit the model\nFinally, we only need to call the bmm function to estimate the model. For this, we pass the data the specified bmmodel and bmmformula to the function. In addition, we can pass additional options to the function to customize sampling (warmup, iter, chains, cores), save the fitted model object (file), or choose the backend the model should be estimated with.\nimm_fit &lt;- bmm(\n  # required inputs\n  data = my_data,\n  model = imm_model,\n  formula = imm_formula,\n  \n  # customize sampler settings\n  warmup = 1000,\n  iter = 2000,\n  chains = 4,\n  cores = 4,\n  \n  # save fitted model object\n  file = \"imm_fit\"\n)\nThe bmm package is closely integrated with brms, the leading R package for Bayesian Regression Models. This allows you to use almost any post-processing and inference method implemented for brms models with the measurement models implemented in bmm\nYou can find more detailed introductions into the different model currently implemented in bmm on the package website. And we have also written a tutorial paper that explains more details about the implementation of several measurement models, and how to specify bmmodels in different experimental settings."

    "section": "Design principles",
    "text": "Design principles\nThe bmm package is built on a few key design principles, some of which were strongly inspired by the brms package for Bayesian regression modeling:\n\nSimplicity\nFitting a cognitive measurement model should be as simple as fitting a linear, logistic or a poisson regression model. You select the model you want to fit, specify a formula to predict how each parameter of the model varies across different experimental conditions, and hit go\n\n\nFlexibility\nthe package should be able to handle a wide range of measurement models and experimental designs. Any model for which you can write down a likelihood function should be able to be fit with bmm. And every parameter in the model should be able to vary across any combination of continuous and categorical predictors. This is a big departure from many existing techniques, which fit models separately to each experimental condition, forcing all parameters to vary across the same set of conditions, and preventing you from including continuous predictors. You should also be able to fix some parameters to specific values, or to impose complex constraints on them\n\n\nHierarhical estimation and one step inference\nRather than fitting each model separately to each participant, the package should allow you to estimate all parameters of the model simultaneously, while accounting for individual differences and benefit from shrinkage and sharing of information. As we detail in our tutorial paper, this has a number of advantages, including more stable estimates of population parameters, better generalization to new data, and more reliable estimates of individual differences (especially when there are few trials per participant)\n\n\nReliability and documentation\nAll models should be thoroughly tested and documented, so you can be confident that the model you are fitting is the model you think you are fitting. Each model should come with references to the relevant literature, so you can understand the theoretical background of the model and how it is implemented in bmm. The package should also provide detailed information on how to specify the model, including which parameters are available and how they can be varied across different experimental conditions\n\n\nParameter recovery\nRelated to the previous point, the package should be able to recover the parameters of the model from simulated data. These parameter recovery studies should be available as online vignettes and be fully reproducible, rather than being buried in the supplementary materials of academic papers (currently work in progress). Any trade-offs in the parameter recovery should be clearly documented, so you can understand the limitations of the model and how to interpret the results.\n\n\nEfficiency and future-proofing\nUse state-of-the-art sampling algorithms and optimization techniques to ensure that the models can be fit quickly and accurately. bmm is built on top of the brms package, which itself is an interface to the Stan probabilistic programming language. This means that the models are fit using the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) algorithm, which is a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. These are packages that are actively maintained, used and supported by a large community of researchers, so that any future advances in the field of Bayesian statistics can be easily incorporated into the package as alternative backends or sampling algorithms. Furthermore, the package should be designed in a modular way, so that new models can be easily added by the community without having to change the core codebase. Finally, we have been working actively with the core developers of brms and Stan to improve sampling speed and stability of existing distributions used by our models."

In fact, we are already working on implementing additional models, such as:\n\nSignal-Detection Models\nEvidence Accumulation Models\nMemory Models for categorical response\n\nIf you have suggestions for models that should be added to the package, feel free to create an issue on GitHub. Ideally this should describe the model, point towards literature that gives details on the model, and if possible link to code that has already implemented the model.\nGiven the dynamic nature the bmm package is currently in, you can always view the latest list of supported models by running:\nbmm::supported_models()\nSo stay tuned for updates and new models! We hope you will find the bmm package useful and will try fitting one of the already available models to your data. We appreciate all feedback and hope that the bmm package will make the use of measurement models easier for everybody."

    "text": "Introducing Vmisc: pkg_vload()\nI was dissatisfied with the existing solutions, so I wrote a package to do that. The Vmisc package provides the pkg_vload function, which allows you to load a specific version of a package, or to install it if it is not already installed. You can start by installing and loading the package:\ninstall.packages('Vmisc', repos = c('https://popov-lab.r-universe.dev'))\nlibrary(Vmisc)\nThe function pkg_vload combines the functionality of library(), remotes::install_version(), and dir.create(), and it also allows you to list as many packages as you want. The simplest option, for everyday use, is to specify just the package names, as you would with library():\npkg_vload(stringr, dplyr, ggplot2)\nIf you already have the package installed, it will load the default version. If you don’t, it will install the latest version from CRAN in the default library. This use case is identical to xfun::pkg_load(), but there is some added functionality for handling different versions of a package.\nTo load a specific version, you can specify the version argument:\npkg_vload(stringr('1.5.1'), dplyr, ggplot2)\nThe function expects a call to the package name, followed by the version in parentheses. It will also recognize if the version you specified is already installed. For example, if you already have stringr version 1.5.1 installed the good old way, it will load it from the default library. And you will see the following output:\n#&gt; Loading required package: stringr\n#&gt; Loading required package: dplyr\n#&gt; Attaching package: ‘dplyr’\n#&gt; Attaching package: ‘ggplot2’\nBut let’s say we want to install version 1.0.0 of stringr. We can do that with the following:\npkg_vload(stringr('1.0.0'))\nwhich results in\n#&gt; Downloading package from url: https://cran.rstudio.com//src/contrib/Archive/stringr/stringr_1.0.0.tar.gz\n#&gt; * installing *source* package 'stringr' ...\n#&gt; ** package 'stringr' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n#&gt; ** using staged installation\n#&gt; ** ## output omitted ##\n#&gt; * DONE (stringr)\n#&gt; Loading required package: stringr\npkg_vload has created a folder stringr-1.0.0 in the default library path, installed the package there, and loaded it from there. The following two folders now coexist:\ndirs = list.dirs(.libPaths(), recursive = FALSE)\ndirs[grepl('stringr', dirs)]\n#&gt; [1] \"C:/Users/vepopo/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.3/stringr\"\n#&gt; [2] \"C:/Users/vepopo/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.3/stringr-1.0.0\"\npkg_vload(stringr('1.0.0')) not only installed the package but also loaded it. If you restart your session, you can load either versions by simply using pkg_vload(stringr) or pkg_vload(stringr('1.0.0')).\npkg_vload(stringr('1.0.0')) # for version 1.0.0\npkg_vload(stringr) # for the default version\nBenefits of using pkg_vload:\n\nvectorized: you can load multiple packages at once\nif a package exists, it will be loaded, otherwise it will be installed and loaded\nyou can specify the version of the package you want to load/install, without having to specify the library path (although you can)\nyou can install as many versions of a package as you want, and they will coexist in the same library path\nyou can switch which version will be the default with another function from the package, pkg_switch_default"

These are options you can set via options(), but they are rarely well documented in the package documentation. The function packageOptions will list all global options used by a package, and their default values. For example, to find all global options used by the brms package, you can use the following:\npackageOptions('brms')\n\n#&gt; Package brms current options:\n#&gt; \n#&gt; brms.save_pars       :  NULL \n#&gt; mc.cores             :  1 \n#&gt; brms.threads         :  NULL \n#&gt; brms.opencl          :  NULL \n#&gt; brms.normalize       :  TRUE \n#&gt; brms.algorithm       :  \"sampling\" \n#&gt; brms.backend         :  \"rstan\" \n#&gt; future               :  FALSE \n#&gt; brms.file_refit      :  \"never\" \n#&gt; wiener_backend       :  \"Rwiener\" \n#&gt; brms.verbose         :  FALSE \n#&gt; shinystan.rstudio    :  FALSE \n#&gt; brms.plot_points     :  FALSE \n#&gt; brms.plot_rug        :  FALSE \n#&gt; brms.short_summary   :  FALSE \n#&gt; .brmsfit_version     :  NULL \nThe function is experimental - it scrapes the source code of the package to find mentions of getOption(‘something’, default = something).

    "text": "The Comfort of Old Habits\nFor many years I had relatively stable workflows for project organization and version control of my research projects. They were never perfect, and given the state of reproducibility in academic psychology, likely much better than the status quo. Since 2014, I’ve been using systematic project template folders, project-based organization, programmatic data wrangling, version control with Git and GitHub, and I’ve dabbled in literate programming tools such as Jupyter Notebooks and R Markdown. I’ve taugth these tools in graduate courses. I knew my way around a command line, and on the rare occasions I needed it, I could run demanding analyses on the Carnegie Mellon computing cluster. I was able to get things done efficiently while maintaining a somewhat decent level of reproducibility.\n\n\n\nI’ve been using the same project structure for 10+ years\n\n\nMy comfortable routine started changing last year, gradually at first, as I began working on my first R package. What began as a side project quickly evolved into something that preoccupied me for months. This was partly because I had a fantastic collaborator, working with whom was an exhilarating, idea-bootstrapping experience. But collaborating also meant I had to up my game — I couldn’t rely on the shortcuts and hacks I’d developed over the years. For the first time, I had to learn about proper documentation, testing, and collaborative workflows.\nWhen you’re working on a package, you’re not just writing code for yourself—you’re writing code for others to use. This means writing clear and concise documentation, creating tests to ensure your code works as expected, and developing code that is modular and easy to understand. And you have to do it in a way that makes collaboration less painful."

    "text": "The Pitfalls of Self-Taught Coding\nThe painful truth is that proper computational skills are rarely taught in academic programs (at least in psychology). Many of us are self-taught, each with our own quirky ways of doing things. Tools and processes that are standard fare in software development are often foreign to us. So, we muddle through, doing the best we can with what we have. My use of GitHub was a glorified Dropbox, and my coding practices, if you could call them that, were a mishmash of concepts I picked up from various tutorials and blog posts. It mostly worked, but even now I am barely able to reproduce my own work from a few years ago. Broken package dependencies, uncertain code order, and the utter lack of systematic documentation have made my old projects a nightmare to revisit.\n\nMaybe I’m exaggerating a bit, but the reality is that as my career has progressed, my projects have grown in number and complexity, and it’s become more and more frustrating to keep track of everything. My existing workflow sat squarely in the middle of “the reproducibility iceberg” - better than most, but I was starting to feel cold.\nThankfully, while formal education in this area still lags behind, the online landscape is now rich with resources. Over the last year, I’ve been trying to incorporate better coding practices, Quarto websites reporting for projects, and renv for package management. It’s been an uphill battle, consuming a lot of time and energy."

One of the reasons I love coding in R is the incredibly quick iteration cycle and feedback loop. The ability to have an idea and, within minutes, simulate, visualize, and analyze it often feels like a superpower.\nThe problem is that this same superpower also makes it so easy to be sloppy. Who has time and patience for carefully curating a reproducible workflow when that puts a delay between your idea and its realization?\nThe thing is, I am no longer a grad student chasing down any odd idea that comes my way. As fun as the wild west of coding can be, it’s not sustainable for a long-term research program, especially when other people depend on you.

Despite all my best intentions, I was shocked to find that I couldn’t reproduce a set of figures I had sent to my collaborator at the time. Even worse, it took me a full day to even figure out what I was doing back then.\nWhy did this happen? There are many culprits, but part of it is that while I coded all the simulation scripts locally, I ran the simulations on a cluster because they were very computationally demanding. At the time, I had no established workflow for sharing intermediate data objects between my remote and local codebases. My attempts to reconstruct what had happened have driven me to the brink of madness. Trust me when I say that I’ve spent more time trying to figure out what I did than it would have taken me to redo everything from scratch.\n\n\n\nWhat a mess…\n\n\nTo avoid scenarios exactly like this, in the last six months I’ve been experimenting with the targets package. Targets is a pipeline toolkit for R that helps you manage the dependencies between your scripts and data objects. It’s a bit like make for R, but with a lot of bells and whistles. I even implemented it for a couple of other projects.\nWhen combined with renv for package management, and Quarto for reporting, it comes close to what I imagine as a nearly ideal scenario: A self-contained research website, with all the code, data, and results in one place, and a clear, reproducible workflow that can be run on any machine. A modern reporting pipeline that is both transparent and efficient."

These are all fantastic tools, with good documentation, and in some respects I feel lucky to be working in a time when such tools are becoming widely available, and there are so many people voluntarily developing them. The open source community is truly a marvel. But the sheer number of moving parts, and the complexity of the interactions between them, is overwhelming.\nGit + Github + renv + Quarto + targets + crew + deployment + credential management + testing + documentation + collaboration + teaching + writing + thinking + living. It’s a lot.\nOk, I got carried away with the list, but even when just considering the computational parts, each of them comes with lengthy manuals, quirks, and a dizzying amount of options and configurations, and they don’t always play nice with each other. I feel like I’m constantly fighting fires, and my self-help tutorials are getting longer and longer. These past 6 months, I’ve spent more time debugging my workflow than actually doing research.\nI’m not giving up, though. This is a path worth walking. I just can’t help but feel there must be a better way. I’ve been trying to code up a personal library of tools to automate some of that complexity, but other things keep getting in the way. I just can’t help but compare this state of affairs to the relatively much smoother package development workflows, largely thanks to devtools and usethis packages, as well as the consistent framework around it. Package development is not any less complex in scope, but the community has managed to converge on an integrated consistent workflow that just works.\nPart of this is the nature of the beast - research projects are by definition more diverse and less predictable than package development. Every project is a new adventure, with its own unique challenges and requirements, and formats vary so widely between disciplines or even subfields. Part of it is also that these tools are still relatively new."

When I look at my best attempts to implement the full workflow, I am a bit paralized by the sheer amount of files and code in my repositories that is not directly related to the substance of the research. There are layers upon layers of abstraction, scaffolding, configuration files, and helper functions that are just necessary for the workflow to function.\n\n\n\nIt’s a lot…\n\n\nTargets itself, for all its truly wonderful functionality, suffers (or at least I do!) from 1) an incredible level of syntax verbosity and 2) too many ways to do the same thing, both of which make it hard to read and understand the code. Flexibility is a double-edged sword.\nEven in an ideal world in which I finally learn all the ins and outs of these packages, I can’t help but wonder: does the improved reproducibility and transparency pay off if barely anyone else can understand what’s going on? If I share the code with expert colleagues, I doubt many of them would be able to make sense of it given the signal-to-noise ratio in the codebase. It might as well be written in a different programming language given the layers of abstraction. This perhaps is a temporary problem, as the tools mature and the community converges on best practices, but it’s a real one.\nThis is not a critique of the tools themselves, but rather a reflection on the complexity of the research process. The tools are a reflection of the complexity of the problem they are trying to solve. But there has to be a better way.\nPS: This post took an unexpected direction. I was planning to write a short introduction to my frustrations, and a detailed guide to targets as I figured out a how to apply it to a new project. I learn best by writing and teaching, and I was hoping that by writing a tutorial I would solidify my understanding of the package. As often happens in writing though, our thoughts, especially those bottled up frustrations, tend to take a life of their own. I guess I might still write the more technical post I was imagining later"

Rather than diffusing its intensity with distance, and simply increasing it with multiple sources, light in this universe is different. When two light beams meet, their combined intensity depends on the angle between them. Right angles are the best - when two light beams meet at a point perpendicularly, they have the highest possible intensity at that point. As the angle becomes smaller or bigger than 90 degrees (pi/2 radians), the intensity becomes weaker.\nWhy would you imagine such a thing? I don’t know why I wonder about such things, but I often do. As an example, I drew the image below while thinking about this - we have two “suns”, the red dots are 90 degree intersections, the blue points are intersections with a smaller angle.\n\nDrawing can only get me so far, but this is an easy enough simulation to do in R, and the results are pretty, especially when we change some of those initial assumptions.

In fact, all points that form the same angle with A and B lie on a circle. This wasn’t immediately obvious to me, but I eventually remembered the inscribed angle theorem from high school geometry. This theorem is a more general case of the well-known Thales’ theorem, which states that all points on a circle form 90-degree angles with any diameter line of the circle. The resulting figure also represents one half of what is known as the Apollonian circles. This realization led me down a Wikipedia rabbit hole, where I read more about alternative coordinate systems like the bipolar coordinate system. At first glance, it seems esoteric and pointless, but it turns out it can simplify many problems that are otherwise too complicated to compute in standard Cartesian coordinate systems.\nAnyway, let’s go on with making pretty variations on this theme.\n\nplot3s(main_plot, hcl.colors(12, \"YlOrRd\", rev = TRUE))\nplot3s(main_plot, c(\"#00FFFF\", \"#8A2BE2\", \"#FFD700\"))\nplot3s(main_plot, wes_palette(\"Royal1\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, how about we add some correlated noise for variety?\n\ngaussian_kernel &lt;- function(sigma_x, sigma_y = sigma_x) {\n  size_x &lt;- ceiling(2 * sigma_x) + 1\n  size_y &lt;- ceiling(2 * sigma_y) + 1\n  \n  kernel &lt;- outer(-size_x:size_x, -size_y:size_y, function(x, y) {\n    exp(-(x^2 / (2 * sigma_x^2) + y^2 / (2 * sigma_y^2)))\n  })\n\n  kernel / sum(kernel)\n}\n\nconvolve2d &lt;- function(mat, kernel) {\n  fft_mat &lt;- fft(mat)\n  fft_kernel &lt;- fft(kernel, dim(mat))\n  Re(fft(fft_mat * fft_kernel, inverse = TRUE) / length(mat))\n}\n\nsmooth_matrix &lt;- function(mat, kernel = gaussian_kernel(1)) {\n  pad_kernel &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = nrow(mat), ncol = ncol(mat))\n  pad_kernel[1:nrow(kernel), 1:ncol(kernel)] &lt;- kernel\n  convolve2d(mat, pad_kernel)\n}\n\ngrid_size &lt;- sqrt(nrow(grid))\nnoise &lt;- matrix(rnorm(grid_size^2), grid_size)\nnoise &lt;- smooth_matrix(noise, kernel = gaussian_kernel(10))\n\nNow won’t you look at that!\n\ngrid$intensity2 &lt;- grid$intensity1 + as.vector(t(noise))\n\nnoise_plot &lt;- grid |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x, y, fill = intensity2, color = intensity2)) +\n  geom_raster() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nplot3s(noise_plot, rev(viridis::inferno(256)))\nplot3s(noise_plot, hcl.colors(12, \"YlOrRd\", rev = TRUE))\nplot3s(noise_plot, c(\"#00FFFF\", \"#8A2BE2\", \"#FFD700\"))\nplot3s(noise_plot, wes_palette(\"Royal1\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, one last one.

Perhaps this is just Stockholm Syndrome as I joked in my “Intro to programming” class recently, though I genuinely enjoy the language and its functional programming roots.\nThat said, there are things that are objectively bad about it, with defaults that no sane person would choose. The more time I spend writing code for packages rather than data analysis, the more I’ve grown annoyed at how much extra work you need to do to avoid perplexing bugs and behavior. This is partly a weakness of dynamically typed languages - rather than depending on type-checking built into the language, you need to program defensively and explicitly handle user-input and whether it is what you expect it to be (see excellent discussions here and here). It’s a problem important enough that it has led to the proliferation of many packages that aim to assist you with it - e.g. checkmate, ensurer, tester, assertive, assertr. But another part is just due to some genuinely weird choices built in many of R’s base functions."

It’s common to suppress output of functions when running many iterations of a chatty function in an analysis script and problems can easily go unnoticed. That’s exactly what happened recently in our Bayesian measurement modeling R package when a colleage reported a weird bug. We have one computational model that can apply different forms of Luce’s choice decision rule - a standard version and a version passed through a softmax normalization. Due to this weird way that switch treats factors, the wrong normalization was applied. This is a recent and not yet officially released model, so we are yet to write all input validations. This could have easily gone unnoticed and led to incorrect model specification that nevertheless lets the model run.\nWarnings are not a reliable way to signal undesired behavior. Especially when the documentation of switch’s warning itself notes that “typically the character level is meant”. Well, if typically a character level is meant, why is the default EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE?!?"

    "section": "Fine, but you tell users “language” should be a character… right?",
    "text": "Fine, but you tell users “language” should be a character… right?\nWe do, but here’s the kicker - R loves to turn character vectors into factors. So much so that disabling such behavior was one of the main motivation behind the development of tibbles. Until R4.0.0, whenever you used a function like read.csv() to read a file as a data.frame, R by default converted character columns to factors. Thankfully now this default has been reversed, but here’s the deal - NOT EVERYWHERE!\nOne place which I never knew R created factors out of character vectors is expand.grid. Expand.grid is a commonly used function to get a data.frame with all combinations of several variables, which is useful for running models with orthogonality manipulated conditions. E.g.:\n\nconditions &lt;- expand.grid(\n  value = c(1, 100),\n  version = c(\"cs\",\"ss\"), \n  choice_rule = c(\"simple\", \"softmax\")\n)\nconditions\n#&gt;   value version choice_rule\n#&gt; 1     1      cs      simple\n#&gt; 2   100      cs      simple\n#&gt; 3     1      ss      simple\n#&gt; 4   100      ss      simple\n#&gt; 5     1      cs     softmax\n#&gt; 6   100      cs     softmax\n#&gt; 7     1      ss     softmax\n#&gt; 8   100      ss     softmax\n\nCan you tell that version and choice_rule are factors? I’ve used expand.grid for years without knowing that default behavior of expand.grid, and it’s partly that standard data.frame print method does not differentiate character and factor columns in any way. You can see that indeed we have factors underneath by using str for more details:\n\nstr(conditions, give.attr = FALSE)\n#&gt; 'data.frame':    8 obs. of  3 variables:\n#&gt;  $ value      : num  1 100 1 100 1 100 1 100\n#&gt;  $ version    : Factor w/ 2 levels \"cs\",\"ss\": 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2\n#&gt;  $ choice_rule: Factor w/ 2 levels \"simple\",\"softmax\": 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2\n\nYou can examine the documentation, or directly check with formals that expand.grid, just like read.csv has a argument stringsAsFactors, which defaults to TRUE:\n\nformals(expand.grid)\n#&gt; $...\n#&gt; \n#&gt; \n#&gt; $KEEP.OUT.ATTRS\n#&gt; [1] TRUE\n#&gt; \n#&gt; $stringsAsFactors\n#&gt; [1] TRUE\n\nWait, but didn’t I just write that R4.0.0 solves the problem? As of R4.4.2, it only does that for read.table and data.frame, but not expand.grid\n\nversion$version.string\n#&gt; [1] \"R version 4.4.2 (2024-10-31)\"\nformals(read.table)[\"stringsAsFactors\"]\n#&gt; $stringsAsFactors\n#&gt; [1] FALSE\nformals(data.frame)[\"stringsAsFactors\"]\n#&gt; $stringsAsFactors\n#&gt; [1] FALSE\nformals(expand.grid)[\"stringsAsFactors\"]\n#&gt; $stringsAsFactors\n#&gt; [1] TRUE\n\nYou can of course change that by being explicit about not wanting factors, or use tidyr::expand_grid alternative instead:\n\nexpand.grid(\n  value = c(1, 100),\n  version = c(\"cs\",\"ss\"), \n  choice_rule = c(\"simple\", \"softmax\"),\n  stringsAsFactors = FALSE\n) |&gt; str(give.attr = FALSE)\n#&gt; 'data.frame':    8 obs. of  3 variables:\n#&gt;  $ value      : num  1 100 1 100 1 100 1 100\n#&gt;  $ version    : chr  \"cs\" \"cs\" \"ss\" \"ss\" ...\n#&gt;  $ choice_rule: chr  \"simple\" \"simple\" \"simple\" \"simple\" ...\n\ntidyr::expand_grid(\n  value = c(1, 100),\n  version = c(\"cs\",\"ss\"), \n  choice_rule = c(\"simple\", \"softmax\")\n) |&gt; str()\n#&gt; tibble [8 × 3] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n#&gt;  $ value      : num [1:8] 1 1 1 1 100 100 100 100\n#&gt;  $ version    : chr [1:8] \"cs\" \"cs\" \"ss\" \"ss\" ...\n#&gt;  $ choice_rule: chr [1:8] \"simple\" \"softmax\" \"simple\" \"softmax\" ..."

    "section": "Consistency is important",
    "text": "Consistency is important\nConsistency is a loaded term. Whether two things are consistent or not necessarily depends on context and goals. One could go on and on about consistent naming styles, consistent argument order, consistent default behaviors, etc. At its core the problem with inconsistent design choices in a programming language is that it makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to build an accurate mental model of how the language works. It’s more than a bit ironic when programming languages, which are supposed to be the precise counterpart of natural languages, become a similar tangled mess of exceptions you need to learn by heart, just like irregular verbs in English.\nThe main example of this post concerns the concept of control flow in programming. Both if/else statements and case/switch statements aim to accomplish the same goal - to execute different parts of a program depending on a prespecified condition. One would expect that logical comparisons would work the same between those two constructs, but as this example has illustrated, they do not in R. Sometimes complex examples obscure the core problems, so let’s present it at it’s simplest form:\n\nx &lt;- factor(\"Peace\", levels = c(\"Violence\", \"Peace\"))\n\nx == \"Peace\"\n#&gt; [1] TRUE\nx == 2\n#&gt; [1] FALSE\nx == \"2\"\n#&gt; [1] FALSE\n\nswitch(x, Peace = \"I choose peace\", Violence = \"I choose violence\")\n#&gt; Warning in switch(x, Peace = \"I choose peace\", Violence = \"I choose violence\"): EXPR is a \"factor\", treated as integer.\n#&gt;  Consider using 'switch(as.character( * ), ...)' instead.\n#&gt; [1] \"I choose violence\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWas Cercei mislead by R? We’ll never know.\n\n\n\nLogical comparisons treat factors as character vectors, switch comparisons treat them as integer values. This is not ok. Sure, you can learn that this is the case, but you shouldn’t have to.\nThese inconsistencies in base R have led to various attempts at reform, most notably through the tidyverse ecosystem. While the tidyverse strongly emphasizes consistency, it presents its own challenges. Breaking changes are frequent, forcing regular code updates and relearning of functionality. While useful for analysis code, the packages’ interdependence and heavy footprint make them difficult to justify in lightweight, stable package development. Many tidyverse functions on the surface appear to simply wrap basic R operations, unnecessarily expanding the language’s complexity. The tidyverse’s impact on the R community remains contentious, sparking numerous debates about its influence (see discussions here, here, here, here, here). My own perspective has evolved from enthusiasm to skepticism, though I still use tidyverse tools when appropriate. I don’t want to throw away the baby along with the bathwater though - despite its drawbacks, the tidyverse gets one thing right: function APIs should be consistent and avoid “magic” behavior. R along with its predecessor S, is an old language, and a lot can be forgiven due to its legacy.\nThis situation mirrors broader patterns in programming language evolution. Consider C++: despite being a modern, widely-used language, it carries significant legacy baggage due to its strict backwards compatibility requirements. Newer languages like Rust, free from such constraints, can implement better defaults and more consistent behavior from the start. The tidyverse represents a curious case of attempting to fix a language’s shortcomings ‘from within’ rather than through dialect separation or replacement. While this approach maintains ecosystem cohesion, it creates a complex divide within the R community.\nPython offers an instructive contrast in language evolution. Through semantic versioning, Python made major breaking changes between versions 2 and 3, prioritizing language improvement over backwards compatibility. While the transition wasn’t painless—Python 2 still claimed 25% usage a decade after Python 3’s 2008 release—by 2023, Python 2 usage had dropped to just 6% (and the transition plans were announced well in advance - PEP 3000 was published in 2006). R, conversely, maintains strong API stability between major versions. Many of the tidyverse’s consistency-oriented features could serve as excellent candidates for a base R rewrite if the community embraced the possibility of meaningful breaking changes in major versions. Yes, such transitions can be challenging—Python’s experience demonstrates this—but they also show that systematic language improvement is achievable with proper planning and community support.”"

Then add more unit tests about edge cases to make sure things like this don’t happen. And so on… We have done this for a lot of our existing code, but as this example taught me, it’s easy to forget - and sometimes easy to not know.\nLong-term, however, I’m becoming more and more interested in programming languages that use a strong static type system. I’ve long taught that static typing is simply annoying - as a self-taught programmer, I haven’t had the benefit of learning things “the right way”. Over the last few months I’ve started digging deeper into programming as a core skill, exploring various languages and resources. I’m growing more and more attuned to the virtues of good type systems, for many other reasons. I’m sure another post on this topic is incoming at some time.

It reliably produces the same mixture of fascination and irritation: the rules are tiny, the behavior is bizarre, and my mind insists that the whole thing should be graspable in some clean way, and then fails to grasp it.\nThis is not a crank post. It’s barely even about Collatz, which was merely a trigger. And yet, as in many number theory questions, whatever the answer is, there surely is one. The system is fully specified. Either every starting value eventually reaches 1, or some don’t. Either there is a nontrivial cycle, or there isn’t. Whether we can find a proof is a separate question.\nOf course, Kurt Gödel is always waiting like an ominous gargoyle to tell us that some things are undecidable (relative to some standard axiom systems). But even if that were the case for Collatz, there is still a fact of the matter: within whatever framework you pick, the statement is either provable, disprovable, or independent. In any case, it’s not like the conjecture floats in some metaphysical fog. It is determined by properties of the positive integers, together with the transition rule.\nWhat interests me, though, is less the conjecture itself than what it does to my head. It’s a very peculiar experience: the sense that something is so “obviously constrained” and yet infuriatingly inacessible and hard. I don’t mean “hard” as in “requires 200 pages of technical machinery.” I mean hard as in: I repeatedly form ideas that feel coherent and so obviously about to crack the problem once and for all; and then they of course evaporate or lead to the same dead ends.\nAnd that experience, is what pushed me into a broader line of thought: what are mathematical objects, what does it mean for them to have properties, and what does it feel like (cognitively) to search for structure in a system when you don’t yet have the right concepts to see it? What does it mean to understand something that by some accounts doesn’t really exist?\nWhatever the ontological status of mathematical objects ultimately is, Platonic, fictionalist, structuralist, model-theoretic, “just” patterns in computation, we can say a few things with relative certainty. One of them is that mathematical objects and structures are essentially relational. They do not have meaningful properties in isolation. Their “properties” are about the role they play inside a system: how they behave under defined operations, and what they entail when they interact with other objects."

I can say “X is roupy” just as easily as I can say “2 is even.” But unless “roupy” connects to something, I haven’t said anything.\nIf I define “roupy” as “paternally upy,” I haven’t fixed the problem. I’ve just stepped one move deeper into a dictionary loop. The words fit together, but nothing constrains anything.\nWith everyday words, we eventually escape this loop by pointing to the world. Some terms get grounded in perception and action. Even if definitions remain fuzzy, there’s friction: you can be wrong about what “red” applies to, and the world pushes back.\nMathematics doesn’t get this kind of grounding, at least not in the same direct way. The mathematician isn’t allowed to point at “two-ness” floating in the air. The only thing left is this: a property of X becomes meaningful only insofar as it connects X to other objects through formal operations and relations. In other words: if the definition doesn’t place X in a structure, it’s not doing anything.\nThe symbols 1, 2, 3, … only mean something, i.e., have properties, once we define operations and rules: Peano’s axioms, or Church numerals, or a set-theoretic construction. Only within such a system does the statement “6 is divisible by 2” have content, because “divisible by 2” can be unpacked and checked under the representation you’re using. It defines a relation between objects of the same class (6 and 2) and the outcome of an operation involving them (like “remainder 0”).\nThe point is not that “definitions matter.” That’s trivial. The point is that mathematical meaning is operational and relational. It lives in what the symbol lets you do and what it forces to be true."

There are three operations:\n\nkuua takes a pin and a bazz and returns a bazz\nouz takes a bazz and returns a bazz plus a pin\nheff takes a bazz and returns a pin\n\nAlso:\n\nyou can always fish a bazz from the void\nyou can ask a bazz whether it is a jazz, and it must answer by nodding or shaking\n\nAnd bazzes satisfy these rules:\n\nIf you kuua a bazz with a pin and then immediately ouz it, you get the original bazz and pin back.\nIf you heff a bazz after kuua-ing it with a pin, you get back that pin – and if you then ouz the bazz, you mysteriously get another free copy of the same pin and the original bazz.\nA freshly fished void bazz always nods when asked if it is a jazz. After kuaa-ing it with a pin it shakes, and once it shakes, it keeps shaking.\n\nIt sounds like nonsense (it is), but it is also just a stack, an Abstract Data Type, in disguise: push(), pop(), peek(), create(), isEmpty():\n\n\n\nBazz operation\nStack operation\nEffect\n\n\n\n\nkuua(pin, bazz)\npush(item, stack)\nAdd a pin to the bazz\n\n\nouz(bazz)\npop(stack)\nRemove and return the top pin\n\n\nheff(bazz)\npeek(stack)\nView the top pin without removing it\n\n\nfish()\ncreate()\nMake a new empty bazz/stack\n\n\nis jazz?\nisEmpty()\nCheck if the bazz/stack has no pins\n\n\n\nWhile the third column of this table clearly articulates the intended effect of the operation, it is nothing more than a “design specification”: what we want it to do and mean. It is the equational rules that endow the system with these behaviors:\n\nouz(kuua(p, b)) = (b, p) — If you push a pin onto a bazz and immediately pop, you get back the original bazz and the pin\nheff(kuua(p, b)) = p — If you peek at a bazz after pushing a pin, you see that pin\njazz(fish()) = true — A freshly created bazz is empty\njazz(kuua(p, b)) = false — Any bazz with at least one pin is not empty\n\nThat’s it - the system is fully specified, regardless of the symbols we use, and the helpful descriptions we attach them and to the rules that govern them. Notice that nothing above ever specifies anything about the internal mechanism of any operation; what is more, it doesn’t even specify the outcome of individual operations, except for what type of object it returns. It only specifies how the behavior of some rules affects others.\nWhat I like about this example is how it separates three things that we often blur together:\n\nThe interface: the operations you’re allowed to do.\nThe axioms: the laws those operations must satisfy.\nThe interpretation: the story we tell ourselves (“it stores things,” “it has an inside,” “it grows,” etc.).\n\nThe axioms never say “last-in-first-out.”, “inside.”, nor “storage.” And yet if you take the rules seriously, you can prove an emergent structural truth, a consequence that wasn’t spelled out:\n\nIf you kuua ten pins in a row and then repeatedly ouz, you recover the pins in reverse order.\n\nAt the same time, some questions you’re tempted to ask are not merely unanswered; they’re not even well-formed in the language of the system. For example: “what happens to the pins inside the bazz?” There is no “inside” predicate. That question sneaks in an external metaphor (containers, interiors) that the abstract description never granted you.\nThis is a genuine constraint on cognition: we naturally reach for metaphors that feel meaningful, and those metaphors can be helpful, but they can also generate pseudo-questions that the formal structure does not support. And I think this distinction between what the system actually says, what it implies, and what our metaphors tempt us to ask is one of the most useful lenses I’ve found for thinking about mathematics."

    "text": "The integers as a deceptively “thin” interface\nNow we can return to the question that started all of this.\nIf mathematical objects are defined by their role in a web of relations, and if that web contains emergent structure that may be deeply non-obvious, then we can ask:\nIs there some deep structural relation among the integers that we have simply not yet uncovered? A structure that plays little to no role in most of our everyday experience with numbers, a structure we cannot currently “see,” but that must be there – because the truth of these edge-case statements depends on it.\nThink about how many of the hardest problems in mathematics are absurdly simple statements about the most elementary object imaginable: the counting numbers.\nOne apple, two apples, three apples. Each of my three kids can have one. If the dog steals one, I either have to cut them or only give apples to two kids. Or my husband and I can enjoy them ourselves. This is the mental world in which the natural numbers first appear: a thin, practical sequence. Knots on a rope.\nThen you learn that primes are numbers divisible only by themselves and 1. Simple definition. A few steps from axioms to an algorithm. Not useful for most of human history; then suddenly the foundation of modern cryptography. And Euclid proves, 2300 years ago, that you’ll never find the biggest prime. There will always be another. Infinitely many.\nBut then you hit questions that look just as simple and fall off a cliff:\n\nAre there infinitely many twin primes? Unknown.\nIs every even number the sum of two primes? Unknown.\nDoes the rule “if (x) is even, divide by 2; otherwise multiply by 3 and add 1” always reach 1? Unknown.\n\nBefore you take these questions seriously, it feels like there is almost no structure to whole numbers at all. They feel like the least interesting object: a mere successor relation repeated forever. And yet the true structure runs deep, as deep as mathematical structures go, and contains relations that feel completely disconnected from the “one apple, two apples” story.\nQuadratic reciprocity. p-adics. Modular forms. The list goes on.\nAnd this is the part that always hits me with the same weird emotion: these consequences were “there” long before we had names for them, as certainly in 100,000 BC when the first humans were learning to count as it is today in number theory textbooks. We just didn’t know it. It still feels like an utter miracle that such complexity was hiding there as an inevitable consequence of logic and formal rules.\nWe know for sure that even extremely sophisticated facts about integers (like Fermat’s Last Theorem) ultimately derive from whatever basic axioms you accept. They have to. There is no other source of truth available. Yet finding that path took centuries and some of the best minds in history.\nIt seems that so much of the complexity arises because the interaction between addition (linear structure) and multiplication (multiplicative/prime structure) is surprisingly “thick.” Most of the deep mysteries in number theory, live exactly in the friction between these two operations. And still, unless you really think about it, on the surface there appears to be nothing particularly interesting about this interaction. Multiplication distributes over addition. They feel separable, almost independent, and yet that feeling is completely misleading."

    "text": "What Collatz does to my mind\nThis is where Collatz comes back in, not as the main topic, but as a trigger.\nThe thing I find psychologically striking is that the Collatz rule has a certain interface-thinness to it. It’s made of the simplest arithmetic operations imaginable (parity, division by 2, multiplication, addition). And yet whatever global behavior it has is not something I can see directly from those operations in the way I can see, say, why a stack is last-in-first-out once I have the right lens.\nWhen I tried to think seriously about it last year, the recurring experience was this:\n\nI’d have an idea that felt like it captured the behavior\nit would feel obviously promising for a few minutes\nand then, as soon as I tried to formalize it, the idea would dissolve into fog\n\nThe dissolving is the interesting part. It’s like my mind keeps proposing consequences or candidate invariants that are almost_meaningful. And then I discover they’re not stable under the operations, or not expressible in the right language, or they fail on some annoying corner case that I can’t rule out. Or most commonly, just lead me to a gaping hole between the properties of numbers I think are relevant to the problem, and how the numbers acted in this system.\nThis feels, to me, like a lesson about cognition as much as about mathematics. And it also makes me appreciate what fundamental mathematical progress often is: not “more cleverness,” but deep and novel structural insight - discovering the right language, the right predicates, invariants, decompositions, and abstractions in which the problem becomes legible."

    "text": "Final notes\nI wasted a month of my life on Collatz last year, despite reading all the jokes and warnings. Never again, at least not in that mode.\nBut I don’t regret the detour entirely, because it pushed me to think about the gap between a formal specification and the space of meanings we think we’re entitled to attach to it.\nThe bazz story is a toy version of this. A few equational laws define an interface. From that interface, real structure follows by logical consequence. At the same time, many of the questions that feel most natural (“what’s inside?” “where do the pins go?”) are not deep mysteries, but category errors.\nSomething similar happens, I think, whenever we look at an austere set of rules like arithmetic, a dynamical map, a formal grammar, rewriting rules, celluar automata, and then try to reason about it with mental imagery that isn’t actually tied to the operations. We drift toward stories, we drift toward pictures, we drift toward “it must behave like…” And sometimes those stories guide discovery. But sometimes they generate pseudo-problems and pseudo-solutions: things that feel meaningful only because we imported them.\nSo for me the interesting thing about Collatz is not the conjecture itself. It’s what it highlights about mathematical meaning. If meaning is relational, constituted by inferential role inside a structure, then “understanding” is about having the right conceptual vocabulary. The vocabulary in which statements become connected to consequences you can control.\nAnd that vocabulary is not guaranteed to sit near the surface of the original definition. Sometimes it’s ridiculously far away. The integers are the canonical example: successor and induction look like a thin interface, and yet the emergent structure is vast, deep and even today poorly understood. The fact that we needed centuries to discover much of that structure for one of the most fundamental everyday concepts is evidence that the inferential consequences of even a small axiomatic core can be profoundly non-obvious."
