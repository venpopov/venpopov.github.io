---

In October 2025, a redesign of the Open Science Framework (OSF) led to widespread access failures across the platform. What began as a few broken download links became, in my case, a total disappearance of eight years of DOI-registered work. This is the story of what happened, how it was resolved, and what it reveals about trust and infrastructure in open science.

## Widespread glitches

On October 11th, 2025, the Center for Open Science (COS) [announced](https://bsky.app/profile/cos.io/post/3m2x2af4jwc2o) that the Open Science Framework — its flagship platform for preprints, data, and code — had received a major redesign. The update promised ["to make managing research projects easier, faster, and more intuitive."](https://www.cos.io/blog/now-live-refreshed-osf-interface)

Within days, many discovered that the new redesign ironically came with slower loading times, but more troubling, with a host of bugs and glitches:

Thanks. I think this is urgent. I suspect it also broke Google Scholar listing PDFs from OSF, at least I get broken links for some, no links for others and generally OSF seems to be massively downranked in the list of sources. Started getting email requests for PDFs again.

I do not mention complaints about design, as those are subjective. But it was worrisome that a redesign would break existing download link patterns without a redirect - this should not happen to an archival service. To their credit, COS fixed that particular problem quickly, though it should never needed fixing in the first place. The performance issues remain, and the irony that this performance update made performance worse is not lost to anyone. What seemed like transitional friction soon turned into something stranger.

## The Disappearance

On November 2, I realized that none of my OSF preprints would open. Every single one — roughly twenty projects spanning eight years — returned either a blank page with a red banner reading “Not found” or a JSON message declaring the resource “deleted by the user.”

At first, I assumed it was a global outage consistent with the widespread performance issues mentioned above. But when I double checked, the pattern was unmistakable:

-   Other authors’ preprints worked fine.
-   The error appeared for every preprint and dataset linked to my name — including one uploaded by a colleague just four days earlier.
-   Even Google Scholar links that had functioned for years now led to “Resource deleted” errors:

``` json
{"message_short": "Resource deleted", "message_long": "User has deleted this content. If this should not have occurred and the issue persists, please report it to <a href=\"mailto:support@osf.io\">support@osf.io<\/a>.", "code": 410, "referrer": null}
```

Most worrisome of all - the "blackout" included files linked in published journal articles and materials for projects currently under  peer review.

I reported the issue to OSF support with screenshots and links, expecting acknowledgment that something had gone wrong with the migration:

Instead, I was asked to fill out a form for “accounts flagged as spam.”

If we don't receive your form submission, we won't be able to investigate the issue. Your input is invaluable as we work to improve our spam detection systems.

## The Support Loop

I filled out the spam-flag form, though I knew my account was active and clean. I was logged into my account and could change my account information. I could also see all my project listings, though not the details. I replied back:

A few hours later I received a message from a new support representative, asking me again to fill out the same form:

Frustrated, I copied Brian Nosek on a detailed escalation email explaining that this was not a single-ticket problem but a catastrophic integrity failure: twenty preprints, hundreds of files, dozens of co-authors, and years of published work were all inaccessible. It was not one “preprint flagged as spam.” Anything I — or anyone associated with me — had uploaded since 2017 was completely inaccessible, and OSF was effectively communicating to the world that this work no longer existed.

I have had an account with OSF for 8 years, I have published about 20 preprints during this time, and none of them are available. For some of them, the OSF links might be the only record online of these published works, and it is a serious issue concerning the longevity of scholarship that an archival platform like OSF cannot allow to happen.

Please see the message history for the detailed report and links to my profile, a subset of broken preprint links, and an API error from Google Scholar links.

Within hours, OSF staff identified the cause: my account had been automatically flagged as spam by their filters. Once the flag was removed, everything reappeared.

## The Explanation

Here’s the message I received:

> \< On Nov 3, 2025 at 19:31 +0100, Michaela Support [support\@osf.io](mailto:support@osf.io){.email}, wrote\>
>
> Thank you for reaching out to the OSF support team! You are correct it looks like your project was caught in our spam filter. As a free open access platform we are frequently the target of spammers, and therefore we must use multiple different spam filters that take a plethora of different factors into account when flagging spam, everything from odd titles to suspicious activity from a nearby IP address could get flagged. Truthfully it's hard to tell why your content got its attention. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. I've removed the flag from material and your content should be active again!

It was an honest reply — but also a disturbing one.

OSF’s filters had quarantined everything I or *any of my colleagues* had *ever* uploaded, without warning, without a visible flag on my dashboard, and without preserving any metadata or landing pages. Public DOIs and Google Scholar entries now pointed to HTTP 410 “Resource deleted” responses — a code that explicitly signals permanent removal to search engines.

In other words, for several days, OSF’s infrastructure told the world that our work no longer existed.

## The Deeper Problem

This incident isn’t about data loss — most of my materials were mirrored elsewhere. The issue is trust.

Researchers use OSF because it promises persistence. It issues DOIs, integrates with journals, and serves as part of the scholarly record. That promise was violated — not through malice, but through a structural design choice: an automated filter was allowed to silently deindex archival content.

Spam detection is necessary. But a true archive must never delete first and explain later. An archive is defined by its immutability and accountability.

The design flaw wasn’t that a spam flag existed — it’s that its activation could unpublish a decade’s worth of DOI-assigned material without human review, notification, or even the retention of metadata.

This episode highlights a broader fragility in the open science ecosystem. The infrastructure of modern scholarship — repositories, indexing services, DOI registries — runs on trust. When that infrastructure silently fails, the damage is epistemic: we lose not just access to data, but confidence in the permanence of the scientific record.

An archival platform must therefore:

-   Retain metadata and landing pages even when content is quarantined.
-   Notify users when materials are flagged or hidden
-   Require human verification before suppressing DOI-linked material.
-   Use non-destructive HTTP codes for temporary removals.

These are not minor UX fixes — they are the foundations of reliability in digital scholarship. I made this much clear in an email reply:

Automatically blocking access to more than twenty DOI-registered preprints, datasets, and supplementary materials spanning nearly a decade — including work co-authored by dozens of researchers and cited in published papers — is not a minor glitch. It constitutes a violation of the very FAIR principles OSF promotes and undermines trust in your platform as part of the scholarly record.

## Aftermath

After I sent my detailed critique, Brian Nosek responded personally and with grace. He acknowledged that this case was unprecedented, thanked me for the thorough documentation, and assured me that it would help the team identify whether others had been similarly affected.

Despite this response, I was still deeply troubled. I briefly considered whether I'm overreacting. After consulting several colleagues, they were unanimous: the severity is not that it happened to me, but that it could happen at all — silently and retroactively. As one colleague put it:

> I agree, I think the issue is more severe than it sounds like. The effect is crazy to me. Not only that they retrospectively delete the stuff but also how many people can be affected by it. It’s already severe in your case with a large network of collaborators. But imagine Klaus's account gets flagged and he doesn’t realize it. This would probably take hundreds of preprints offline, which are primary the work of others \[junior researchers\]. It’s bad enough that they take the stuff down that you put on OSF but it also deletes the work where someone else just linked your name with? This also can’t be right...

After some reflection, I followed up with Brian Nosek with a longer message explaining why the issue mattered so deeply: not because of personal inconvenience, but because silent retroactive suppression of long-standing records is incompatible with the role of an archive.

It's not about my work and that it affected me personally, although that clearly made me more motivated to get to the bottom of it. My work is also backed up on other platforms, including ResearchGate, a University of Zurich repository and my personal website. The real problem is that something like this should not be possible to happen in the first place, let alone as the result of an automated filter.

This is why I am being so adamant about this incident being taken so seriously.

His reply was thoughtful and for the moment I am satisfied that this incident will be taken seriously:

We truly appreciate your willingness to put time into documenting and sharing the challenges you experienced here.

That, to me, felt like the right place to stop. Ideally, I’d still like an official statement from COS about what they plan to do to ensure that something like this doesn’t happen again.

## Data vs. Trust

No data were ultimately lost. But something far more important was at stake: the continuity of the scholarly record.

If this episode serves any purpose, let it be a reminder that openness is not just about making information accessible — it’s about ensuring it stays accessible. Scientific infrastructure must be engineered for trustworthiness, not just availability.

As we argued in a recent perspective paper, [the traditional publishing system is rotten to the core](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2401231121). But for any reform to succeed long-term, people must trust the infrastructure and systems in place.

Trust is slow to earn and quick to erode. I hope OSF uses this experience to reinforce that trust — not only by fixing the bug, but by institutionalizing the safeguards that make open scholarship durable.
