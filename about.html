I am currently a PhD student at <a href='http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/'>Carnegie Mellon University</a> and the <a href="http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/">Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition</a>. I work with Prof. Lynne Reder in exploring the neural and mental mechanisms of memory formation, knowledge representation and retrieval.
